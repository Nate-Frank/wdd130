            <button class="accordion">Salt Lake City</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>With no wrong way to go being surrounded by mountains and with avid adventurers in all corners, Salt Lake City has a great diversity when it comes to opportunities to have a fantastic day-trip. The Draper trail system features a great variety of interesting trails like Rush, Vertigo, and Levitate for those looking for high speed flow and jumps. Crossing the Valley its possible to find some trails in Herriman that have a rockier trail surface mixed in with some rock gardens, and the occasional mild flow line. Some noteworthy trails are called Eric’s which has a little bit of everything.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Eagle Mountain</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Off the beaten path Eagle Mountain is home to a great number of trails and even a Cross Country race course loop but despite all this is often seen as a backup option and second choice when visiting the Salt Lake area. These trails hold up exceptionally well when it rains or even lightly snows and if they do become muddy often dry up quickly making this the place to go after or even during a rainy day to get the most bang for your buck. There are two distinct areas of Eagle Mountain, the first beginning a short distance after hidden hollow elementary with a small beginner course as well as several cross-country courses and trails. The Second area is primarily a skills area that contains a variety of Jumps, Drops, Berms, Rollers, and even wall rides.</p>

                <h2>Cedar City</h2>
                <p>Cedar City is located in a fantastic position to do just about anything in southern Utah. If you want to travel to St. George but don’t want to be around so many people, Visit Cedar City and it’s a Short Hour drive to St. George with plenty of locations to Hike, Bike, or Camp. Within Cedar City itself, the 3 peaks trail system is highly recommended due to the large amount of diverse trails available to hike and bike on, its Disc Golf Course, as well as camp sites and designated places for High Power RC cars. There are some trees and Shrubs around but be prepared during the summer with extra water and some place to get some shade during the hottest part of the day.</p>
