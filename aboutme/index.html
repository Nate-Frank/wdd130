    <h2>"Nate"</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Nathan though many people call me Nate, I personally do not have a perference. When I have freetime
        or need to take a break from things I like to go mountain biking, some of my favorite trails can be found in St.
        George, Utah. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints my whole life. I served my
        mission in both Lima, Peru and Los Angeles, California Due to Covid.</p>
    <p>I currently work at a call center helping with the scheduling of staffing to ensure that we can operate
        smoothly. I have always enjoyed computers and using them to learn new things, I've only been coding for 3-5
        months almost exclusivly with pyhton. I hope that with further eduction I can move to our development team where
        I am currently employed or look for a new employer as my skills grow.</p>
